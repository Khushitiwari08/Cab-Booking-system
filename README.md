# Cab-Booking-system

Cab Booking is a method that may be utilized for a price for a limited length
of time. People who do not have access to their own personal automobile or
do not own one at all can travel around by renting a car. Individuals who
wish to hire or rent an automobile must first contact the desired vehicle's
cab rental business. This may be done over the internet.
This individual must now provide certain information, such as the rental
dates and automobile type. Following the completion of these data, the
person renting the automobile must produce a valid identification card. The
majority of enterprises in the sector earn based on the sort of automobiles
they sell. Customers can use an online booking system to rent cabs.
Customers may use this online system to find available taxis, register cabs,
see profiles, and book cabs. Taxi booking is a typical kind of transportation
that is offered by a number of different transportation firms in a particular
city. The bulk of people rely on taxi services for their daily transportation
needs. The company must be registered and fulfil all of the transportation
department's requirements and security requirements.
The Online Cab Booking System is a web-based platform that allows your
customers to order taxis and executive cabs from their own home or office
